## Task
Since I cannot use php, I need an alternative. <br><br>
Today, I learnt about **Jekyll** and how i can use include.  First I needed to make an `_includes` directory and then I set about making the files.
<br>
<br>
Where php uses require, **Jekyll** uses include as follows:
  `{% include [insert name of html file] %}`.  Note, you will not need the brackets. <br>
