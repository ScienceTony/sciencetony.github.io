## Task
Since I cannot use php, I need an alternative. <br><br>
Today, I learnt about **Jekyll** and how i can use include.  Fisrt I needed to make an `_includes` directory and then I set about making the files.
<br>
<br>
Where php uses require, **Jekyll** uses include as follows:
  `{% include [insert name of html file] %}`.  Note, you will not need the [ ] brackes. <br>
Like php, i can now create blocks of code and then use include to call them when i need them.  I can also us different defult templates and storm them in the `_Layouts` folder. <br>
I made a `_layouts` directory and added a default template to it. <br><br>
This will make maintainace much easier now.
