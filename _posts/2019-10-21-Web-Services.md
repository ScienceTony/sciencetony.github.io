## Task outline
Find out about web services. 

## Output or results of activity
Web services allows you to expose the functionality of your existing code over the network. 
Once it is exposed on the network, other application can use the functionality of your program.

I learned about 2 approaches to web services:
* SOAP
* REST

SOAP uses xml, has headers, a body, is transported over the internet using http and is a standard in its own right while REST uses standard internet protocols, has less overheads than SOAP and is not restriced to xml: it can use JSON too. 

## Comments on knowledge and skills demonstrated 
* Spent a lot of time at the OU library reading
