Check webpage load time and speed up site.  In order to achieve this, 
First, check the speed of my site using [pageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) from Google.
Second, act upon analysis feedback and carry out at least one suggestion made.

## Output or results of activity
I spent many hours looking for diferent ways to check the speed of my site, but googles pageSpeed insights was by far the best. 
The google resorce made a number of saggestions including to '_Serve images in next-gen formats_', which i followed up on. 
However, the recomended formats do not cover all the browsers. For instance, webP does not work with Safari!
