                <h3>Christianity</h3>
                <p>I was Baptised in the Baptist tradition when i was 26yrs old. Since then I have been to many churches of different denomination.</p>
                <p>I enjoy a Christian lifestyle for many reasons. Here are a few of those reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I like being sober.</li>
                    <li>I like giving in to peace.</li>
                    <li>I like listening to famous Christian speakers.</li>
                    <li>Going to Church and singing hymns is a lot of fun.</li>
                    <li>Being charitable</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Protestantism and Baptists</h4>
                <p>The Baptist Church is a major branch of Protestantism, which is the second largest form of Christianity and accounts for about 40% of all Christians.</p>
                <h4>Baptism and Alpha groups</h4>
                <p>Baptists believe in baptisms of full submersion. 
                    Giving a short testimony before being baptised is traditional. 
                    If a member of the public wishes to learn more about being a Christian and being baptised, 
                    they attend Alpha group meeting over a period of weeks in order to decide if it is what they really want to do.</p>
