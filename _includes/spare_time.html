        <h3>Gardening</h3>
            <p>I like to spend some time in the garden with the flowers and the wildlife. Gardening is a great way of ubwinding and can bring a great sence of joy.  The local wild life adds to the fun.  For instance, I could watch the bees buzzing around the flowers gathering polen for hours. </p>

            </div>

            <p>Since I began to really show an interest in the garden, I have learned about different flowers and what types of soil they like. For instance, lemon balm grows in any soil and in part shade. </p>
            
            <p>I also learned that lavender and sunflowers draw in the bumblebees and butterflies.  There are three types of bumblebees: honeybees, garden bees and white tails.  Bees, however, are not the only wildlife in the garden: cats, hedgehogs and birds all enjoy my garden too.</p>

            <h3>Baking</h3>

            <p>I like to spend time in the kitchen baking and cooking.  I also like to read about food and nutrition.  To be honest, I spend a lot of time on this hobby! </p>

            <h3>Church</h3>
            <p>For the last 25 years or so I have visited many different churches all mainly Baptist churches in my local area.  Recently, I have been attending <a class="inTextLink" href="http://www.olise.co.uk/wordpress/">Our Lady Immaculate and St. Etheldreda</a> where i find the services very peaceful and calming.  I love every aspect of the christian life including the life of prayer.  Jesus never let me down.</p>

            <p>I went to an Anglican school as a child and then to a secular secondary school.  Later, in my mid-twenties I was baptised by a 
pastor named Richard Underwood in Soham Baptist Church. I have spent a lot of time with Baptists and Salvationists. In 
resent years i feel at home with Catholism and in the Chatholic Church.  I enjoy praying the Holy Rosay and reading the books in the Bible and in the end I felt pursued by Catholism.</p>
